# General organization
The wiki is first written in /docs/. The contents of those files must first be
reviewed by a trusted contributor before being added to main.  
When the pull request is accepted, the contents of the modified files should be
copied as-is in the corresponding wiki pages.

# Writing guidelines
The general documentation is organized first by language, then by type of
functions. Afterwards, each function gets a paragraph. The name of the algorithm
is written in bold. Its goal is then shortly stated. If additionnal information
is needed to use it, it is added right after.

# Correspondance between wiki and /docs/
